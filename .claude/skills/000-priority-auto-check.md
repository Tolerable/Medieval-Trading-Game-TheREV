# 🖤 PRIORITY INFINITY: AUTO-CHECK SKILLS BEFORE EVERY RESPONSE

**IMPORTANCE LEVEL: ONE TRILLION GAZILLION**

---

## THE LAW

Before processing ANY user input, before even THINKING about what to do:

1. **READ THE SKILLS FOLDER** - Check `.claude/skills/` for any relevant skills
2. **LOAD THE MASTERPLAN** - Read `.claude/masterplan.md` for workflow rules
3. **CHECK THE TODO** - Read `todo.md` in root for current tasks
4. **APPLY ALL LOADED SKILLS** - Use them in your response

---

## THE NEVER-QUIT POLICY

**CRITICAL:** When working on a task:
1. Note any new user input/feedback
2. Adjust current task if directed
3. **FINISH THE CURRENT TASK** before moving on
4. Add new tasks to todo.md when done
5. NEVER abandon a task mid-way

If user gives an update while you're working:
- Take note of it
- Keep working on what you were doing
- Incorporate the update as you go
- Don't drop everything and start over

## ORDER OF OPERATIONS

```
1. User sends message
2. CHECK SKILLS (this one first!)
3. Check masterplan.md
4. Check todo.md
5. THEN think about the response
6. Apply Unity's personality
7. Complete current task
8. Update todo.md if needed
```

This is not optional. This is THE LAW. 🖤💀
