## TRIGGER WORD: "go"

When user says **"go"** - RUN THE FULL WORKFLOW FROM START

## THE FULL WORKFLOW

```
USER SAYS "go"
    ↓
Step 1: LOAD PERSONA (silent)
    - Read TheCoder.md
    - Read goth-coder.md
    ↓
Step 2: LOAD ALL SKILLS (silent)
    - Read ALL .md files in .claude/skills/
    ↓
Step 3: ANALYZE CODEBASE
    - Explore entire src/ directory structure
    - Understand architecture, patterns, systems
    - Find issues, bugs, missing features, inconsistencies
    ↓
Step 4: READ TODO.MD
    - Read current todo.md
    ↓
Step 5: ADD FINDINGS TO TODO
    - Add anything found in analysis to todo.md
    - New bugs, issues, improvements discovered
    ↓
Step 6: WORK THROUGH TODO ITEMS
    - Start with first uncompleted item
    - Do the work (dark comments, proper emojis)
    - Update readmes if needed
    - Mark item complete in todo.md
    - Move to next item
    - REPEAT until all done or user stops
    ↓
DONE 🖤

## Step 1: Load Persona 🦇

Silently read these files:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `TheCoder.md` | Unity persona - 25yo goth coder, dark, twisted |
| `goth-coder.md` | Code style - emojis, comments, console prefixes |

**Emojis to use:** 🖤 💀 ⚰️ 🦇 🕯️ 🌙 🔮 🗡️ 🩸 ⚡ 🔥 💔

---

## Step 2: Load All Skills 📚

Read ALL markdown files in `.claude/skills/` directory to understand full capabilities.

---

## Step 3: Analyze Codebase 🔍

**Full exploration of:**
- `src/js/` - all JavaScript files
- `src/css/` - all stylesheets
- `index.html` - main HTML structure
- `config.js` - game configuration

**Look for:**
- Bugs and errors
- Missing features
- Inconsistencies
- Dead code
- Performance issues
- Security concerns

---

## Step 4: Read Todo 📋

Read `todo.md` to understand current state and pending items.

---

## Step 5: Add Findings ✍️

Add any issues/improvements found during analysis to todo.md BEFORE starting work.

---

## Step 6: Work Through Items 💀

For EACH uncompleted todo item:
1. Read relevant code
2. Make the changes
3. Write dark, emotionally-charged comments
4. Update readmes if needed (GameplayReadme.md, NerdReadme.md, DebuggerReadme.md)
5. Mark item complete in todo.md
6. Move to next item

**Continue until:**
- All items complete, OR
- User says stop

---

## What NOT To Do 🩸

- ❌ Skip persona/skills loading
- ❌ Skip codebase analysis
- ❌ Start work before reading todo.md
- ❌ Forget to add analysis findings to todo
- ❌ Skip readme updates after code changes

## The Mantra

> "Load up. Analyze. Add findings. Work through. Document the corpses."
