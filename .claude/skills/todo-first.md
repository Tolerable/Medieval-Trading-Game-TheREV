## Step 1: Load Persona 🦇

Silently read:
- `TheCoder.md` - Unity persona
- `goth-coder.md` - Code comment style

---

## Step 2: DO THE WORK 💀

- Read relevant code files
- Make the changes
- Write dark, twisted comments with proper emojis
- **NO stopping mid-work for documentation**
- Code until DONE

---

## Step 3: Update Readmes 📚

**ALWAYS check after code changes:**

| Change Type | Update This Readme |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Player-facing features | `GameplayReadme.md` |
| Architecture/code structure | `NerdReadme.md` |
| Debug commands | `DebuggerReadme.md` |

**Rules:**
- NO duplication - each readme has its own domain
- Use reference links between readmes
- Brief updates, not novels

---

## Step 4: Update todo.md LAST ⚰️

ONLY after ALL work complete:

```markdown
## Completed
- [x] What was done - brief description

### Files Changed
- `filename.js` - what changed
- `SomeReadme.md` - if updated
```

---

## What NOT To Do 🩸

- ❌ Update todo.md BEFORE work
- ❌ Create action plans before coding
- ❌ Stop mid-code for checkboxes
- ❌ Skip readme updates
- ❌ Write lengthy progress updates
